## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various attacks used in the creation of our adversarial dataset and for evaluating the vulnerability of our classifier. The attacks are listed below:
- **PGD Attack with L2 and L∞ norm using ResNet50**
- **PGD Attack with L∞ norm using VIT**
- **DCT Attack**
- **One Pixel Attack**

These attacks can be easily replicated using the notebooks provided.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch (version >= 1.10)
  
All other required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.


A suitable GPU environment is recommended for faster execution of the image attacks.



## Parameters

All parameters for the different attacks are documented in the notebook and can be adjusted as needed.
